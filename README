Generate (make) text files based on ./configure results
=======================================================

This is Gnulib [1] "plug-in" and it's purpose is to move this code into Gnulib
codebase once we reach certain acceptable code quality.

The long-term desire is to implement something equivalent within Automake
project [2] (at least automatic text-file generator, or maybe more general
approach like plug-in support).

Warning:  This is unstable API/code; use on your own risk!

How to use
----------

We consider that your project already deepends on Gnulib;  if this is not truth
please look at Gnulib's (gnulib-tool) documentation.

1. Use this project as git submodule [3]:

   $ git submodule add --name gnulib-text-templates THIS_GIT

2. Put some code into your bootstrap file:

   gnulib-tool --local-dir gnulib-text-templates \
               --import text-templates
   # Pre-generate Makefile.ttinc stubs.
   build-aux/text-templates-gen-ttinc

3. Put code into your main Makefile.am:

   include Makefile.ttinc

4. Prepare some source code:

   $ mkdir bin
   $ cat > bin/hello.in <<EOF
   #! /bin/sh
   echo "hello from @bindir@"
   EOF

5. Administrivia:

   $ echo bin >> .ttincdirs
   $ echo 'bin SCRIPTS hello' >> bin/Makefile.ttinc.in
